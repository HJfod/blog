# About Support DMs

This is a short tutorial on how to ask for help on Discord.

If you we're linked to this blog post, please don't take it as an offense. I don't mean this as a passive-aggressive insult – rather as a genuine goodwilled offer of advice. I want to help everyone, but I ask that those who ask for help make it a little easier for me to do so.

I get a lot of messages daily, and while I do try my best to reply to all of them, it might take hours or even days for me to be able to do so – you're going to save yourself a log of time by being clear in your first message and having to wait for me to ask further questions.

## Please ask your question straight away

It's fine to say "Hi", "How are you doing", "Could I ask a question", but you don't have to wait for my response to that! Just send another message right after with your question, or include it in your first message directly.

## Please include as much information as possible

Of course you can't know all the information I might need, because if you did you could probably just Google the question. But if for example your game is crashing, please say what mods you have, what you were doing when the game crashed, and whatever else you can think of. **Rather say way too much than too little – I know how to filter out the unnecessary details.**

## Images! Please, images!

If your problem can be described with an image, or better yet, a video, please include one! Or a crashlog, or any other related material! Anything that goes beyond just text usually goes a long way

## I don't speak Russian or Spanish

I will not respond to you in any other language than English, Finnish, or Swedish.

## Please never *ever* try to call me.

I will immediately unfriend you without warning. I don't like calls. With anyone.
